Ansible Vault
=============

Pre-requisites:
- [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/)

When you try to process an encrypted vault, you will need a password.
You have the option of specifying you password (in plain text), or
specifying your vault password file. If nothing is specified in the
settings, then you will be prompted for your password every time.

To peek into an encrypted vault, you can either, open your command
pallette and search for `Ansible Vault: View` or, you can use the menu:
`Tools` > `Ansible Vault` > `View`

Viewing will open a new, read only tab. But this will not modify the
original vault. If you want to modify a vault, you should `decrypt`
instead.
