Ansible Vault
=============

Changelog
---------

- Fixed bug where the view would sometimes not update with the filesystem changes
- Forcing YAML syntax highlighting on `View` command new file.

Fixing the view update bug requires that this plugin takes the output of the ansible command and put it into the current view.
This makes a a dirty change on the currently open file rather than modifying the filesystem.
As a result, you will have to save the file before running the encrypt command.
